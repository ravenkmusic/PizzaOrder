You run a pizza shop, and offer three types of pizzas:

Margherita: $7
Caprese: $9
Formaggio: $10
If customers want, they can add an unlimited number of extra options: either "ExtraSauce" for $1 or "ExtraToppings" for $2.

Your task is to write code that assists the customer in figuring out the cost to them.
